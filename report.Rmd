The main goal of our analysis was to investigate the potential relationship between pesticide use and bee populations. We found that there is a small, but measurable, effect from pesticides on the bee population. This relationship, as evident by the Pearson correlation coefficient plot within our [Exploratory Analyses](https://misbath.github.io/bee_project.github.io/exploring.html) yielded information on pesticide use and bee population change over time. We found that compunds  Chlorpyrifos and Chlorothalonil are used in much higher quantities across all years. These two compunds specifically, have formualations and solvents that are known to be highly oral toxic to bee larvae [Zhu et. al](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077547).
As seen on figures 1 and 2, the increase in pesticide corresponds almost perfectly to the drops in honey bee and bee populations plotted. However, as shown in figure 3, the number of colonies does not seem to be affected by the variation in pesticide use.

Additionally we wanted to visually represent the use of pesticides and colonies across spatially by state. Figures 4 and 5 show number of colonies and cummulative pesticide use by state. As seen in these maps, California has a high number of honey producing colonies and a moderate use of cummulative pesticides. However, states like Georgia, which use quite a large amount of pesticides has a small number of honey producing colonies. States along central United States do not show a clear relationship between the exposure and outcome. We presume other environmental factors, such as climate are at play here.



Lastly during our exploratory analysis, we wanted to look at the correlation among the selected six compunds. Table 1 shows the correlation coefficients; specifically we oberved a highly possitive correlation between Chlorpyfiros, Imidacloprid and Chlorothalonil use, which is confirmed by the plotted use in Figure 1.

The [Additional Analysis](https://misbath.github.io/bee_project.github.io/add_analysis.html) is quite variable across States.
