To gauge the changes in the top six pesticides used in the entire country we looked at the  pesticide use per year across over time:

<br>

The graph above shows the continued weight of pesticide used in the United States from 2004-2016. As seen, two of the six compunds are much greatly used, Clhlorpyfiros and Chlorothalonil. These two compunds are known to be insecticides that can potentially lead to nervous fucntion loss in bees, as well as the loss of bee population loss.

Further, we wanted to look at the correlation of state-level pesticide use accross all years.   
Pearson correlation is shown below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
library(readxl)
library(corrplot)


knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	warning = FALSE,
	fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
corr_state = read_csv("./data/top_pesticides.csv") %>% 
  group_by(compound, state_fips) %>%
  summarise(mean_pest_high = mean(epest_high_kg, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "compound",
    values_from = "mean_pest_high",
  ) %>% 
  select(-state_fips)

corr_state %>%
  view()

matrix_state_1 = cor(corr_state, use = "everything", method = c("pearson"))
matrix_state_1

matrix_state_2 = cor(corr_state, use = "complete.obs", method = c("pearson"))
matrix_state_2

#visualization 

corrplot(matrix_state_2, order = "hclust", type = "full")

```
