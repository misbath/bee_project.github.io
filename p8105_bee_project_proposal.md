### Project Title

Pesticide Use and Bee Colonies in the United States

### Motivation

Bee colony decline has made headlines in recent news reports. The
decrease in bee survival has been linked to a decrease in crop
diversity, loss of habitat, poor beekeeping practices, and widespread
and intensive use of pesticides such as neonicotinoids. As a group we
are interested in trends between pesticide use and bee populations. If
the bee population continues to decline, biodiversity of plants across
the country will continue to decline, with potentially catastrophic
implications to our food crops.

### Intended Final Project

### Anticipated Data Sources

  - Pesticide use:
    <https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/county-level/>
  - Bee population:
    <https://data.world/finley/bee-colony-statistical-data-from-1987-2017>
  - County name and FIPS:
    <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=county-codes>

### Analyses/Visualizations/Coding Challenges

In our initial descriptive analyses we will report counties (aggregated
into regions) that have seen the largest changes in bee population
during the time period where data are available. We will also describe
pesticide use.

We propose to study the association between pesticide use and change in
bee population over time in a county to identify the pesticides most
strongly related to bee decline. We intend to produce vizualizations of
pesticide use and change in bee populations, across various years and
for various identified pesticides of concern by county.

Given that the publicly available data focus on agricultural pesticide
use, we will not be considering residential pesticide use and
acknowledge that represents a potentially important limitation.
Additionally, we anticipate that there will be variability in the extent
and quality of pesticide use reporting across the US. The first coding
challenge that we expect is merging county and zip code information to
use as a common identifier across the datasets.

### Planned Timeline

November 13: Clean dataset to help with data exploration November 15:
Decide on specific analyses after further data exploration and divide
work accordingly. November 22: Complete all analyses and incorporate
into one website repository. November 27: Record video outlining results
to incorporate into website December 5: Submit final project December
10: Present project
