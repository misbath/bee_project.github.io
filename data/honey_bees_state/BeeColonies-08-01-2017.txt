Varroa Mites Top Colony Stressor for Operations with Five or More Colonies

Varroa mites were the number one stressor for operations with five or more 
colonies during all quarters of 2016. The quarter of April through June 2016 
had highest percentage of colonies reported to be affected by varroa mites at 
53.4 percent. The percent of colonies reported to be affected by varroa mites 
during January through March 2017 and April through June 2017 are 42.2 
percent and 41.6 percent, respectively.

Colonies Lost with Colony Collapse Disorder Symptoms Down 27 Percent for 
Operations with Five or More Colonies 

Honey bee colonies lost with Colony Collapse Disorder symptoms on operations 
with five or more colonies was 84.4 thousand colonies from January through

Colonies lost with Colony Collapse Disorder Symptoms were reported to meet 
all of the following criteria: 1) Little to no build-up of dead bees in the 
hive or at the hive entrance 2) Rapid loss of adult honey bee population 
despite the presence of queen, capped brood, and food reserves 3) Absence or 
delayed robbing of the food reserves 4) Loss not attributable to varroa or 
nosema loads.

highest number of honey bee colonies loss during any quarter for 2016. The 
quarter in 2016 with the least number of colonies lost was April through 
June, with 4.10 thousand colonies.

Honey bee colonies added for operations with less than five colonies during 
the quarter of April through June 2016 was 12.0 thousand colonies, the 
highest number honey bee colonies added during any quarter of 2016. The 
quarter in 2016 with the least number of colonies added was October through 
December, with 760 colonies. 

Honey bee colonies renovated for operations with less than five colonies 
during the quarter of April through June 2016 was 3.40 thousand colonies, the 
highest number of honey bee colonies renovated during any quarter of 2016. 
The quarter in 2016 with the least number of colonies renovated was October 
through December, with 450 colonies.

Varroa Mites Top Colony Stressor for Operations with Less than Five Colonies

During 2016, the highest reported colony stressor was varroa mites, with 17.6 
percent of the colonies reported to be affected. This is an 11 percent 
decrease from the previous year.

Colonies Lost with Colony Collapse Disorder Symptoms for Operations with Less 
than Five Colonies Down 40 percent

Honey bee colonies lost with Colony Collapse Disorder symptoms on operations 
with less than five colonies was 4.20 thousand colonies during 2016, a 40 
percent decrease from 2015. Colonies lost with Colony Collapse Disorder 
Symptoms were reported to meet all of the following criteria: 1) Little to no 
build-up of dead bees in the hive or at the hive entrance 2) Rapid loss of

Statistical Methodology

Survey Procedures: Data for operations with honey bee colonies are collected 
from a stratified sample of operations that responded as having honey bees on 
the Bee and Honey Inquiry and from the NASS list frame. For operations with 
five or more colonies, data was collected on a quarterly basis; operations 
with less than five colonies were collected with one, annual survey. NASS 
Regional Field Offices maintain a list of all known operations with honey 
bees and use known sources of producers to update their lists. All operations 
are mailed a questionnaire and given adequate time to respond by mail or 
electronic data reporting (EDR). Those that do not respond by mail or EDR are 
telephoned or possibly enumerated in person. 

Estimation Procedures: Estimates were prepared by the Agricultural Statistics 
Board after reviewing recommendations and analysis submitted by each Regional 
Field Office. All data were analyzed for unusual values. Data from each 
operation were compared to their own past operating profile and to trends 
from similar operations. Data for missing operations were estimated based on 
similar operations or historical data. National and State survey data were 
reviewed for reasonableness with each other and estimates from the previous 
quarters using a balance sheet.  

Revision Policy: The previous year's estimates are subject to revision when 
current year's estimates are made. Revisions are the result of late reports 
or corrected data. Estimates will also be reviewed after data from the 5-year 
Census of Agriculture are available. No revisions will be made after that 
date.

Reliability: Since all operations with honey bees are not included in the 
sample, survey estimates are subject to sampling variability. Survey results 
are also subject to non-sampling errors such as omissions, duplication, and 
mistakes in reporting, recording, and processing the data. While these errors 
cannot be measured directly, they are minimized through strict quality 
controls in the data collection process and a careful review of all reported 
data for consistency and reasonableness.

Terms and Definitions of Honey Bee Colony Estimates

Added colonies: A new or replacement, surviving colony that was either 
created or purchased whole by an operation. 

Colony: A hive containing a queen honey bee and attendant worker bees and/or 
drone bees.

Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) criteria: Colonies reported as being lost due 
to CCD must have fully met four criteria: 1) Little to no build-up of dead 
bees in the hive or at the hive entrance 2) Rapid loss of adult honey bee 
population despite the presence of queen, capped brood, and food reserves 3) 
Absence or delayed robbing of the food reserves 4) Loss not attributable to 
varroa or nosema loads. Colonies lost due to CCD were collected on a 
quarterly basis for operations with five or more colonies. Colonies lost due 
to CCD on operations with less than five colonies were collected annually and 
for the year as a whole.

Lost colony: A completely failed colony, loss of most workers, and possibly 
the queen. Colony is no longer viable. Sometimes referred to as a dead out. 

Maximum colonies: Refers to the sum of colonies in a state on the first of 
the quarter plus all those moved into the state during that period. Maximum 
colonies is considered the base number from which a data user can do further 
analysis. It does not include the colonies that were added, lost, or 
renovated in the state. Colonies are counted in every state they were in 
during the quarter; therefore, a national level maximum number of colonies 
cannot be calculated due to duplication.

Nuc: A smaller sized hive box with reduced numbers of bees and brood, usually 
containing a queen; used for expansion of the apiary operation or renovating 
an existing colony.

Package: A shipping container with several pounds of honey bees that may or 
may not include a queen; used for expansion of the apiary operation or 
renovating an existing colony. 

Percent lost: The state-level percentage of colonies lost is the number of 
colonies lost in that state divided by the maximum colonies for that state. 
The national level percentage of colonies lost is the total number of all 
colonies lost in the United States divided by the number of colonies on the 
first of the quarter.

Percent renovated: The state-level percentage of colonies renovated is the 
number of colonies renovated in that state divided by the maximum colonies 
for that state. The national level percentage of colonies renovated is the 
total number of all colonies renovated in the United States divided by the 
number of colonies on the first of the quarter.

Renovated colony: An existing colony that was requeened or received a nuc or 
package. 

Stressors: State level colony health stressors for operations with five or 
more colonies are the percent of the maximum colonies reported to be 
affected, by quarter. The national level colony stressors is the summed 
number for the United States divided by the number of colonies on the first 
of the quarter. The health percentages for operations with less than five 
colonies are the percent of colonies reported to be affected during the 
entire year divided by the maximum number of colonies for all purposes 
reported to be on operations with less than five colonies, collected from the 
Bee and Honey Inquiry.
