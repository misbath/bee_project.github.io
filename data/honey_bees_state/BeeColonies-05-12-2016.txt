January 1 Honey Bee Colonies Down 8 Percent for Operations with Five or More 
Colonies

Honey bee colonies for operations with five or more colonies in the United 
States as of January 1, 2016 totaled 2.59 million. This is 8 percent below 
the 2.82 million colonies on January 1, 2015. During 2015, honey bee colonies 
on April 1, July 1, and October 1 were 2.85 million, 3.13 million, and 2.87 
million, respectively. 

Honey bee colonies lost for operations with five or more colonies during the 
quarter of January-March 2016, was 429 thousand colonies or 17 percent lost. 
The quarter of January-March 2015 had a loss of 500 thousand colonies or 18 
percent, the highest honey bee colonies loss of the five quarters. The 
quarter of April-June 2015, at 353 thousand or 12 percent, showed the least 
amount of lost honey bee colonies.

Honey bee colonies added for operations with five or more colonies during the 
quarter of January-March 2016 was 378 thousand colonies. The quarter of 
April-June 2015, added 662 thousand colonies, the highest number of honey bee 
colonies added of the five quarters. The quarter of October-December 2015, at 
117 thousand, showed the least amount of honey bee colonies added. 

Honey bee colonies renovated for operations with five or more colonies during 
the quarter of January-March 2016 was 158 thousand colonies or 6 percent. 
This is the lowest number of colonies renovated during the five quarters. The 
number of colonies renovated during the quarter of January-March 2015 was 271 
thousand or 10 percent. The highest number of honey bee colonies renovated 
for any quarter, at 693 thousand, occurred during April-June 2015. Renovated 
colonies are those that were requeened or received new honey bees through nuc 
or package. 

Varroa Mites Top Colony Stressor for Operations with Five or More Colonies

Varroa mites were the number one stressor for operations with five or more 
colonies during each of the quarters surveyed. The quarter of January-March 
2016 showed varroa mites at 34.3 percent. The quarter of April-June 2015 
showed the highest percentage of varroa mites at 43.4 percent affected. 

Colonies Lost with Colony Collapse Disorder Symptoms for Operations with Five 
or More Colonies

Colonies with loss reported that met all of the following criteria: 1) Little 
to no build-up of dead bees in the hive or at the hive entrance 2) Rapid loss 
of adult honey bee population despite the presence of queen, capped brood, 
and food reserves 3) Absence or delayed robbing of the food reserves 4) Loss 
not attributable to varroa or nosema loads, peaked at 114 thousand colonies 
lost during January-March 2016. That same quarter a year ago showed 92.3 
thousand colonies lost. 

Honey Bee Operations with Less than Five Colonies 

Honey bee colonies for operations with less than five colonies in the United 
States on January 1, 2015 were 50.0 thousand. Honey bee colonies on April 1, 
July 1, and October 1, 2015; 43.0 thousand, 52.0 thousand, and 49.0 thousand, 
respectively.

Honey bee colonies lost for operations with less than five colonies during 
the quarter of January-March 2015, was 15.5 thousand colonies, the highest 
honey bee colonies loss during 2015. The quarter of April-June 2015, at 5.50 
thousand, showed the least amount of lost honey bee colonies during the year.

Honey bee colonies added for operations with less than five colonies during 
the quarter of April-June 2015, was 15.0 thousand colonies, the highest honey 
bee colonies added during the year. The quarter of October-December 2015, at 
860, showed the least amount of added honey bee colonies. 

Honey bee colonies renovated for operations with less than five colonies 
varied by quarter. The highest number of honey bee colonies renovated for any 
quarter, at 3.80 thousand, occurred during April-June 2015. The quarter of 
October-December 2015, with 470, was the lowest number of honey bee colonies 
renovated for any quarter.

Colony Stressor for Operations with Less than Five Colonies

Unknown colony health stressors, at 20.8 percent, was the highest for 
operations with less than five colonies during 2015. Varroa mites was the 
next ranked stressor at 19.8 percent.

Colonies Lost with Colony Collapse Disorder Symptoms for Operations with Less 
than Five Colonies

Colonies with loss reported that meet all of the following criteria: 1) 
Little to no build-up of dead bees in the hive or at the hive entrance 2) 
Rapid loss of adult honey bee population despite the presence of queen, 
capped brood, and food reserves 3) Absence or delayed robbing of the food 
reserves 4) Loss not attributable to varroa or nosema loads, totaled 7.00 
thousand colonies during 2015.

Statistical Methodology

Survey Procedures: Data for operations with honey bee colonies are collected 
from a stratified sample of operations that responded as having honey bees on 
the Bee and Honey Inquiry and from the NASS list frame. For operations with 
five or more colonies, data was collected on a quarterly basis; operations 
with less than five colonies were collected with one, annual survey. NASS 
Regional Field Offices maintain a list of all known operations with honey 
bees and use known sources of producers to update their lists. All operations 
are mailed a questionnaire and given adequate time to respond by mail or 
electronic data reporting (EDR). Those that do not respond by mail or EDR are 
telephoned or possibly enumerated in person. 

Estimation Procedures: Estimates were prepared by the Agricultural Statistics 
Board after reviewing recommendations and analysis submitted by each Regional 
Field Office. All data were analyzed for unusual values. Data from each 
operation were compared to their own past operating profile and to trends 
from similar operations. Data for missing operations were estimated based on 
similar operations or historical data. National and State survey data were 
reviewed for reasonableness with each other and estimates from the previous 
quarters using a balance sheet.  

Revision Policy: The previous year's estimates are subject to revision when 
current year's estimates are made. Revisions are the result of late reports 
or corrected data. Estimates will also be reviewed after data from the 5-year 
Census of Agriculture are available. No revisions will be made after that 
date.

Reliability: Since all operations with honey bees are not included in the 
sample, survey estimates are subject to sampling variability. Survey results 
are also subject to non-sampling errors such as omissions, duplication, and 
mistakes in reporting, recording, and processing the data. While these errors 
cannot be measured directly, they are minimized through strict quality 
controls in the data collection process and a careful review of all reported 
data for consistency and reasonableness.

Terms and Definitions of Honey Bee Colony Estimates

Added colonies: A new or replacement, surviving colony that was either 
created or purchased whole by an operation. 

Colony: A hive containing queen bee and attendant worker bees and/or drone 
bees.

Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) criteria: Colonies reported as being lost due 
to CCD must have fully met four criteria: 1) Little to no build-up of dead 
bees in the hive or at the hive entrance 2) Rapid loss of adult honey bee 
population despite the presence of queen, capped brood, and food reserves 3) 
Absence or delayed robbing of the food reserves 4) Loss not attributable to 
varroa or nosema loads. Colonies lost due to CCD were collected on a 
quarterly basis for operations with five or more colonies. Colonies lost due 
to CCD on operations with less than five colonies were collected annually and 
for the year as a whole.

Lost colony: A completely failed colony, loss of most workers, and possibly 
the queen. Colony is no longer viable. Sometimes referred to as a dead out. 

Maximum colonies: Refers to the sum of colonies in a state on the first of 
the quarter plus all those moved into the state during that period. Maximum 
colonies is considered the base number from which a data user can do further 
analysis. It does not include the colonies that were added, lost, or 
renovated in the state. Colonies are counted in every state they were in 
during the quarter; therefore, a national level maximum number of colonies 
cannot be calculated due to duplication.

Nuc: A smaller sized hive box with reduced numbers of bees and brood, usually 
containing a queen; used for expansion of the apiary operation or renovating 
an existing colony.

Package: A shipping container with several pounds of honey bees that may or 
may not include a queen; used for expansion of the apiary operation or 
renovating an existing colony. 

Percent lost: The state-level percentage of colonies lost is the number of 
colonies lost in that state divided by the maximum colonies for that state. 
The national level percentage of colonies lost is the total number of all 
colonies lost in the United States divided by the number of colonies on the 
first of the quarter.

Percent renovated: The state-level percentage of colonies renovated is the 
number of colonies renovated in that state divided by the maximum colonies 
for that state. The national level percentage of colonies renovated is the 
total number of all colonies renovated in the United States divided by the 
number of colonies on the first of the quarter.

Renovated colony: An existing colony that was requeened or received a nuc or 
package. 

Stressors: State level colony health stressors for operations with five or 
more colonies are the percent of the maximum colonies reported to be 
affected, by quarter. The national level colony stressors is the summed 
number for the United States divided by the number of colonies on the first 
of the quarter. The health percentages for operations with less than five 
colonies are the percent of colonies reported to be affected during the 
entire year divided by the maximum number of colonies for all purposes 
reported to be on operations with less than five colonies, collected from the 
Bee and Honey Inquiry.
