Special Note

Data collection for July 2019 quarterly honey bee colonies has been 
suspended. Before deciding to suspend data collection, NASS reviewed its 
estimating programs against mission- and user-based criteria as well as the 
amount of time remaining in the fiscal year to meet its budget and program 
requirements while maintaining the strongest data in service to U.S. 
agriculture. Information about all NASS surveys and reports is available

Statistical Methodology

Survey Procedures: Data for operations with honey bee colonies are collected 
quarterly from a stratified sample of operations that responded as having 
five or more honey bee colonies on the Bee and Honey Inquiry and from the 
NASS list frame. NASS Regional Field Offices maintain a list of all known 
operations with honey bees and use known sources of producers to update their 
lists. All operations are mailed a questionnaire and given adequate time to 
respond by mail or electronic data reporting (EDR). Those that do not respond 
by mail or EDR are telephoned or possibly enumerated in person. 

Estimation Procedures: Estimates were prepared by the Agricultural Statistics 
Board after reviewing recommendations and analysis submitted by each Regional 
Field Office. All data were analyzed for unusual values. Data from each 
operation were compared to their own past operating profile and to trends 
from similar operations. Data for missing operations were estimated based on 
similar operations or historical data. National and State survey data were 
reviewed for reasonableness with each other and estimates from the previous 
quarters using a balance sheet.  

Revision Policy: The previous year's estimates are subject to revision when 
current year's estimates are made. Revisions are the result of late reports 
or corrected data.

Reliability: Since all operations with honey bees are not included in the 
sample, survey estimates are subject to sampling variability. Survey results 
are also subject to non-sampling errors such as omissions, duplication, and 
mistakes in reporting, recording, and processing the data. While these errors 
cannot be measured directly, they are minimized through strict quality 
controls in the data collection process and a careful review of all reported 
data for consistency and reasonableness.

Terms and Definitions of Honey Bee Colony Estimates

Added colonies: A new or replacement, surviving colony that was either 
created or purchased whole by an operation. 

Colony: A hive containing a queen honey bee and attendant worker bees and/or 
drone bees.

Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) criteria: Colonies reported as being lost due 
to CCD must have fully met four criteria: 1) Little to no build-up of dead 
bees in the hive or at the hive entrance 2) Rapid loss of adult honey bee 
population despite the presence of queen, capped brood, and food reserves 3) 
Absence or delayed robbing of the food reserves 4) Loss not attributable to 
varroa or nosema loads. Colonies lost due to CCD were collected on a 
quarterly basis for operations with five or more colonies. Colonies lost due 
to CCD on operations with less than five colonies were collected annually and 
for the year as a whole.

Lost colony: A completely failed colony, loss of most workers, and possibly 
the queen. Colony is no longer viable. Sometimes referred to as a dead out. 

Maximum colonies: Refers to the sum of colonies in a state on the first of 
the quarter plus all those moved into the state during that period. Maximum 
colonies is considered the base number from which a data user can do further 
analysis. It does not include the colonies that were added, lost, or 
renovated in the state. Colonies are counted in every state they were in 
during the quarter; therefore, a national level maximum number of colonies 
cannot be calculated due to duplication.

Nuc: A smaller sized hive box with reduced numbers of bees and brood, usually 
containing a queen; used for expansion of the apiary operation or renovating 
an existing colony.

Package: A shipping container with several pounds of honey bees that may or 
may not include a queen; used for expansion of the apiary operation or 
renovating an existing colony. 

Percent lost: The state-level percentage of colonies lost is the number of 
colonies lost in that state divided by the maximum colonies for that state. 
The national level percentage of colonies lost is the total number of all 
colonies lost in the United States divided by the number of colonies on the 
first of the quarter.

Percent renovated: The state-level percentage of colonies renovated is the 
number of colonies renovated in that state divided by the maximum colonies 
for that state. The national level percentage of colonies renovated is the 
total number of all colonies renovated in the United States divided by the 
number of colonies on the first of the quarter.

Renovated colony: An existing colony that was requeened or received a nuc or 
package. 

Stressors: State level colony health stressors for operations with five or 
more colonies are the percent of the maximum colonies reported to be 
affected, by quarter. The national level colony stressors is the summed 
number for the United States divided by the number of colonies on the first 
of the quarter.
